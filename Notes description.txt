First Day Agenda

1- Set up the github{Repository}
	a- new environment
	b- setup.py
	c- requirements.txt



First Day
open github and create repo with name 'mlproject'
create new folder name as "mlproject"
do to that folder and copy the path of that folder.
open anaconda propmt and go to that folder locations
type 'code .', it willl open vs code.
in code open new terminal
1- Creating new enviroment in code== conda create -p venv python==3.8 -y
2- in code type 
	git init
	git add README.md
	git commit -m "first commit"
	git branch -M main
	git remote add origin https://github.com/suzankhan06/mlproject.git
	git push -u origin main
2- remember-- if you are setting the github and push and commit for the first time then you also have to do "git global" google it
3- create setup.py and requirements.txt files in your vs code.
4- the the details in setup.py files as i wrote in my vs code.
5- create  one folder as 'src' means source folder and inside it create one file name as '__init__.py'
this is coz whenever it will check for find_packages from setup.py it will look for the src folder and inside it, it will look for '__init__.py' file and take all the packages.


exception.py file to error_message basically we create this file for showing us whenever we get error in our program.

logger.py we create  for logging info, so whenever we get the error we use logging.info file to log in and then execute the error which we had.
